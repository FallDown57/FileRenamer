# File Renamer by Bro
A dope little app to rename all your files and folders in a snap. Free forever!

## How to Use
1. Run `renamer.exe` (grab it from releases or build it yourself).
2. Pick a folder, type a base name, hit "Rename ‘Em!"
3. Boom—files renamed like `cool1.jpg`, `cool2.pdf`, etc.

## Build It Yourself
- Got Python 3? Install deps: `pip install Pillow`
- Run `build.bat` to make `renamer.exe` (needs PyInstaller: `pip install pyinstaller`).
- Find it in `dist/`.
